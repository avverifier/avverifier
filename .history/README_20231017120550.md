# Academic Paper Contract Verification Project

This repository houses the datasets and tools used for a contract verification research project. The project encompasses benchmark data of 10 contracts, among which 6 are vulnerable and 4 are non-vulnerable. Subsequent modifications were made to change the 6 vulnerable contracts to non-vulnerable and the 4 non-vulnerable contracts to vulnerable. The details of each contract are stored in `contract_info.json` under each benchmark sub-directory.

## Benchmark Data

The benchmark data is organized into individual folders under the `benchmark` directory. Each folder represents a contract and contains the following files:

- `contract_info.json`: Contains information about the contract, including the blockchain chain it belongs to (e.g., Ethereum), contract address, vulnerable injection points, and functions. Example of `contract_info.json` file:

```json
{
    "chain": "eth",
    "ContractAddress": "0x085E34722e04567Df9E6d2c32e82fd74f3342e79",
    "vulnerable injection point": "LendongPool.sol",
    "vulnerable injection function": "deposit"
}
