# Academic Paper Contract Verification Project

This repository houses the datasets and tools used for a contract verification research project. The project encompasses benchmark data of 10 contracts, among which 6 are vulnerable and 4 are non-vulnerable. Subsequent modifications were made to change the 6 vulnerable contracts to non-vulnerable and the 4 non-vulnerable contracts to vulnerable. The details of each contract are stored in `contract_info.json` under each benchmark sub-directory.

## Benchmark Data

The benchmark data is organized into individual folders under the `benchmark` directory. Each folder represents a contract and contains the following files:

- `contract_info.json`: Contains information about the contract, including the blockchain chain it belongs to (e.g., Ethereum), contract address, vulnerable injection points, and functions. Example of `contract_info.json` file:


**FixedFunction.sol**: The modified contract file where the vulnerability has been fixed.  
**VulnerableInjection.sol**: The modified contract file where a vulnerability has been introduced.

## Tools
There are three tools utilized in this project:

### AVVERIFIER
- **stack.py**: Implementation for EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).
- **solstatic.py**: Implementation for a detector.

### Mythril Modify
- **external_calls.py** and **check_storage.py**: Implementation of the methods discussed in the paper.
- **cp_mythril.py**: A test file. Place contract addresses in `ca_open.txt` to use.

### Ethainter Dector
A datalog script written for vulnerability detection. Before running, install gigahorse and use `getissue.dl` as the runtime datalog file. This will generate a `GetIssue.csv` file containing vulnerable functions.

## Installation
1. Install [gigahorse](https://github.com/nevillegrech/gigahorse-toolchain) for running Ethainter Dector scripts.
2. Place your contract addresses in `ca_open.txt` for testing with `cp_mythril.py`.
3. Ensure you have the necessary environment setup for running Ethereum-based tools and scripts.

## Usage
Provide detailed steps on how to use the tools and access the benchmark data.
